Another rule of thumb -- the number of neurons in the last layer should match the number of classes you are classifying for. In this case it's the digits 0-9, so there are 10 of them, hence you should have 10 neurons in your final layer.\n\n</p>\n</details>","metadata":{"id":"VqoCR-ieSGDg","cell_id":"4d8b3c1cbe41429c8f02fd2b1a2540fd","deepnote_cell_height":276.34375,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fmnist = tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist\n\n(training_images, training_labels) ,  (test_images, test_labels) = fmnist.load_data()\n\ntraining_images = training_images/255.0\ntest_images = test_images/255.0\n\nmodel = tf.keras.models.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),\n                                    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation=tf.nn.relu),\n                                    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation=tf.nn.softmax) # Try experimenting with this layer\n                                  ])\n\nmodel.compile(optimizer = 'adam',\n              loss = 'sparse_categorical_crossentropy')\n\nmodel.fit(training_images, training_labels, epochs=5)\n\nmodel.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)\n\nclassifications = model.predict(test_images)\n\nprint(classifications[0])\nprint(test_labels[0])","metadata":{"id":"MMckVntcSPvo","cell_id":"299ca996bc844dda9782466dc6bd72e6","source_hash":"fb5a304c","output_cleared":true,"execution_start":1668360939068,"execution_millis":33769,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Exercise 5: \n\nConsider the effects of additional layers in the network.

Why do you think that would be the case? \n\n- Try 15 epochs -- you'll probably get a model with a much better loss than the one with 5\n- Try 30 epochs -- you might see the loss value decrease more slowly, and sometimes increases. You'll also likely see that the results of `model.evaluate()` didn't improve much. It can even be slightly worse.\n\nThis is a side effect of something called 'overfitting' which you can learn about later and it's something you need to keep an eye out for when training neural networks.

Not bad. But how do you make that even better? One way is to use something called _convolutions_. We're not going into the details of convolutions in this notebook (please see resources in the classroom), but the ultimate concept is that they narrow down the content of the image to focus on specific parts and this will likely improve the model accuracy. \n\nIf you've ever done image processing using a filter (like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing))), then convolutions will look very familiar. In short, you take an array (usually 3x3 or 5x5) and scan it over the entire image. By changing the underlying pixels based on the formula within that matrix, you can do things like edge detection. So, for example, if you look at the above link, you'll see a 3x3 matrix that is defined for edge detection where the middle cell is 8, and all of its neighbors are -1. In this case, for each pixel, you would multiply its value by 8, then subtract the value of each neighbor. Do this for every pixel, and you'll end up with a new image that has the edges enhanced.\n\nThis is perfect for computer vision because it often highlights features that distinguish one item from another. Moreover, the amount of information needed is then much less because you'll just train on the highlighted features.\n\nThat's the concept of **Convolutional Neural Networks**. Add some layers to do convolution before you have the dense layers, and then the information going to the dense layers is more focused and possibly more accurate.\n\nRun the code below. This is the same neural network as earlier, but this time with [Convolution](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Conv2D) and [MaxPooling](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/MaxPool2D) layers added first. It will take longer, but look at the impact on the accuracy.","metadata":{"id":"zldEXSsF8Noz","cell_id":"14d81b79b60049619e8c7bf18ae207e0","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Define the model\n\nclass customCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):\n    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):\n        if (logs.get('accuracy') >= 0.94):\n            self.model.stop_training = True\n\nmodel = tf.keras.models.Sequential([\n                                                         \n  # Add convolutions and max pooling\n  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),\n  #tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (4,4), activation='relu'),\n  #tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2,2),\n\n  # Add the same layers as before\n  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),\n  tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),\n  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')\n])\n\n# Print the model summary\nmodel.summary()\n\n# Use same settings\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Train the model\nprint(f'\\nMODEL TRAINING:')\nmodel.fit(training_images, training_labels, epochs=10, callbacks=[customCallback()])\n\n# Evaluate on the test set\nprint(f'\\nMODEL EVALUATION:')\ntest_loss = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)\n","metadata":{"id":"C0tFgT1MMKi6","cell_id":"e11c1d91975241a3b837c044d509cb7f","source_hash":"294bd9f2","output_cleared":false,"execution_start":1670185159381,"execution_millis":198705,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Model: \"sequential_3\"\n_________________________________________________________________\n Layer (type)                Output Shape              Param #   \n=================================================================\n conv2d_2 (Conv2D)           (None, 26, 26, 32)        320       \n                                                                 \n flatten_3 (Flatten)         (None, 21632)             0         \n                                                                 \n dense_6 (Dense)             (None, 128)               2769024   \n                                                                 \n dense_7 (Dense)             (None, 10)                1290      \n                                                                 \n=================================================================\nTotal params: 2,770,634\nTrainable params: 2,770,634\nNon-trainable params: 0\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nMODEL TRAINING:\nEpoch 1/10\n1875/1875 [==============================] - 49s 26ms/step - loss: 0.3908 - accuracy: 0.8613\nEpoch 2/10\n1875/1875 [==============================] - 49s 26ms/step - loss: 0.2538 - accuracy: 0.9071\nEpoch 3/10\n1875/1875 [==============================] - 49s 26ms/step - loss: 0.1973 - accuracy: 0.9276\nEpoch 4/10\n1875/1875 [==============================] - 49s 26ms/step - loss: 0.1547 - accuracy: 0.9431\n\nMODEL EVALUATION:\n313/313 [==============================] - 2s 7ms/step - loss: 0.2908 - accuracy: 0.9028\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":6},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It's likely gone up to about 92% on the training data and 90% on the validation data. That's significant, and a step in the right direction!\n\nLook at the code again, and see, step by step how the convolutions were built. Instead of the input layer at the top, you added a [Conv2D layer](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Conv2D). The parameters are:\n\n1. The number of convolutions you want to generate. The value here is purely arbitrary but it's good to use powers of 2 starting from 32.\n2. The size of the Convolution. In this case, a 3x3 grid.\n3. The activation function to use. In this case, you used a ReLU, which you might recall is the equivalent of returning `x` when `x>0`, else return `0`.\n4. In the first layer, the shape of the input data.\n\nYou'll follow the convolution with a [MaxPool2D](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/MaxPool2D) layer which is designed to compress the image, while maintaining the content of the features that were highlighted by the convlution. By specifying `(2,2)` for the MaxPooling, the effect is to quarter the size of the image. Without going into too much detail here, the idea is that it creates a 2x2 array of pixels, and picks the biggest one. Thus, it turns 4 pixels into 1. It repeats this across the image, and in doing so, it halves both the number of horizontal and vertical pixels, effectively reducing the image to 25% of the original image.\n\nYou can call `model.summary()` to see the size and shape of the network, and you'll notice that after every max pooling layer, the image size is reduced in this way. \n\n\n```\nmodel = tf.keras.models.Sequential([\n  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),\n  tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2, 2),\n```\n","metadata":{"id":"uRLfZ0jt-fQI","cell_id":"5026b42d522e43aabb83142ffb519876","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Then you added another convolution and flattened the output.\n\n\n\n```\n  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),\n  tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2,2)\n  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),\n  \n```\n","metadata":{"id":"RMorM6daADjA","cell_id":"a84f877902ab4eb98989bfd98aba5e60","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"After this, you'll just have the same DNN structure as the non convolutional version.

But while the results might seem really good, the validation results may actually go down, due to something called _overfitting_. In a nutshell, overfitting occurs when the network learns the data from the training set really well, but it's too specialised to only that data, and as a result is less effective at interpreting other unseen data. For example, if all your life you only saw red shoes, then when you see a red shoe you would be very good at identifying it.
